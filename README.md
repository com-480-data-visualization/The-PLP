[Milestone 1](#milestone-1) • [Milestone 2](#milestone-2) • [Milestone 3](#milestone-3)

## Milestone 1 (29th March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

> Find a dataset (or multiple) that you will explore. Assess the quality of the data it contains and how much preprocessing / data-cleaning it will require before tackling visualization. We recommend using a standard dataset as this course is not about scraping nor data processing.

### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.


Our project is to highlight the impact of weapons on the number of gun deaths worldwide.

To do this, we're going to create a website containing an interactive map of the world. There will be a first 'discovery' tab on which we can select a country and obtain all the main information (population size, number of guns per inhabitant, number of gun deaths per year...). In the second 'quiz' tab, there's a didactic aspect, where when we click on a country we have to guess its name and its degree of danger (low, medium, high).


### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
